;;THIS SCRIPT IS FOR LINUX + DVORAK.  AUTOHOTKEY-v1.0.  TESTED IN FULL ON DEBIAN-MATE-12.6.  CONVERT THE SYSTEM KEYBOARD FIRST!  
;;PRESS RWIN FOR LOCKWORKSTATION, !r RENAME, !e EXPLORER, !d DUPLICATE, ^t TRANSPARENCY, ^SPACE ALWAYSONTOP & ^!SPACE DOUBLE-TAP FOR SUSPEND.  THIS SCRIPT GENERALLY CLONES CTRL WITH ALT (!c/!v FOR COPY/PASTE, ETC).  PRESS ALT AGAIN IF IT FAILS TO RELEASE DUE TO LAGGY SEND.
;;NO <! FOR LALT,  NOR MOUSE ALTS.  LINUX CAPSLOCK REGISTERS DIFFERENTLY, SO USE * WHEREVER POSSIBLE.  EXAMPLE: CAPPED F12 & SPACE ARE DIFFERENT TO F12 & SPACE, ETC.  MAPPING QWERTYâ†’DVORAK TOO RISKY. BUT IN PRINCIPLE AHK SHOULD MAP THE WHOLE KEYBOARD.
;;~70 LINES & ~500 WORDS.  COMMENTS DON'T EXIST IN FINAL EXECUTABLE, BUT EVERY COMMAND IS IN FULL.
